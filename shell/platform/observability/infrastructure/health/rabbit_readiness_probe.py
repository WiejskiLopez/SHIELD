"""BrokerReadinessProbe for RabbitMQ — confirms broker reachability for readiness.

Opens a real broker connection with a bounded timeout and closes it again. A
successful round-trip proves the broker is reachable; any failure is reported as
an error string in ``checks`` instead of raising, so the /readiness endpoint can
answer 503 with a diagnostic body.
