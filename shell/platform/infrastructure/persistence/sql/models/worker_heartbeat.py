"""Factory for the ``worker_heartbeat`` model.

A long-lived polling worker records its heartbeat (``worker_id`` + ``last_seen_at``)
here so readiness probes can tell a live worker from a dead one — lease holders
alone are not proof of liveness (ref4.md Krok 4). The worker_id is the primary key,
so one row exists per worker process/configuration.
