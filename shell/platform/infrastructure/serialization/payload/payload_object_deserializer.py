    Every field is rebuilt from the payload keyed by its name; the envelope-owned

    A required field that is absent from the payload raises instead of being
    silently filled with an empty value. Fields marked with
    ``PAYLOAD_REQUIRED_KEY`` in ``metadata`` are mandatory even when they carry a
    default: they must travel in the payload (identity fields, e.g. ``command_id``).
