"""User bounded context contract catalog — explicit public allowlist.

The catalog is NOT a derived view of the registry: every public contract is
declared explicitly here with its owner, producers and consumers. Adding an
event to the registry without an explicit catalog entry fails the architecture
test (``test_contract_catalog.py``).
